Description:
  In Linux based operating systems, creating a new file of any type is as simple as right clicking and
  naming your file. On windows, its a more irritating process. I decided to simplify file creation on
  windows. This is a python program that simply prompts a user for a file name/path and creates it
  exactly as entered. This project was made much more for my own satisfaction than for learning a
  language or demopnstrating skill.
