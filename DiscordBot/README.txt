This is a Discord bot that runs in multiple servers in my friendgroup. It was made for fun, and jokes,
and has a lot of functionality that is very specific to my applications. It's not designed to be stable,
or portable, or usefull in any way, just fun. Originally written with Discord.NET v 0.9 , upgraded to 1.0
