Description:
  This is a Discord bot that runs in multiple servers in my friendgroup. It was made for fun, and jokes,
  and has a lot of functionality that is very specific to my applications. It's not designed to be stable,
  or portable, or useful in any way, just fun. Originally written with Discord.NET v 0.9, now fully
  updated to 1.0.2. Actually fairly stable now. 
  
  Updates include console logging on most events (command triggers, user pm's to bot)
  Latest update also allows optional archiving of all messages visible to bot on all servers the bot is in.
  Bot may require low tier administrator privileges to function properly. Not sure why right now.
  
  Commands, prefix '!': 
  !commands [list of commands] 
  !poke [sends pm to user]
  !countdown [creates timer of user defined time] 
  !badmeme [posts joke picture]
