Description:
This is a Chrome extention (available, unlisted on the Chrome Web Store: 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flickur-image-scraper/nafeobijolhocicekaehgbhgdgcojcaf )
that scrapes a Flickr webpage for the image link of photos with restricted download permissions,
and downloads them.
I created this Chrome extention for the purpose of learning Javascript primarily, rather then to
scrape Flickr. It just happened to be a resasonably simple problem to solve, and one with practical
and tangible results. Version one of the project was developed in a single afternoon primarily
during a Geograpical and Information Sciences class.
